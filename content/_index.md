Hi, I am Srayan Bhattacharyya.

I am in my final year of Bachelor's in Electrical Engineering from Jadavpur University, and shall be joining Chevron as a Facilities Engineer. This is where you will find my blog posts. I found it a nice idea to have my page where I can have all my write-ups and blog posts instead of having them scattered all over external websites (mostly Codeforces). 
All my past blog posts originally posted as an entry in the Codeforces blog will be found here, and any further appropriate blog will be posted on both platforms.

While you are here, why donâ€™t we play a short game of **_Two Truths and a Lie_**? Have a go -
- $(A A^\prime + B B^\prime)(A B + A^\prime B^\prime)$
- $(A + B)(A^\prime + B^\prime) + (A B + A^\prime B^\prime)$
- $(A + B + A^\prime B^\prime) (A^\prime + B^\prime + A B)$
