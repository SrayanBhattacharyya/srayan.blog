There might be unwanted errors, so please feel free to to share any suggestions, corrections or concerns. For those who are unware of Binary Exponentiation, this CP-Algorithms article or this video by Errichto can help get familiar with it.\nIntroduction\nNow that we know the idea behind binary exponentiation; let us try expanding the idea. Say, we break the problem into two parts, $L$ and $R$, such that, once we have both the results, combining them gives us our final answer as $ans = L \\odot R$, where $\\odot$ is an associative binary operator. If  we can find $R$ as a function of $L$ as in $R = f(L)$ fast enough, say $O(X)$, then our final answer can be found in  $O(X \\cdot log(n))$.\nThe idea is simple enough, so we now have a look at some simple examples. For the sake of simplicity we assume problem size $n$ is of form $2^k$ , $k \\in \\mathbb{Z}$ .\nExample 1: Calculating $a^n$\nWe are starting from the simplest example. We know that $ans = \\underbrace{a \\cdot a \\dots \\cdot a \\cdot a }_\\text{ n times}$. If we take $R = f(L) = L$, where $L = a^{n/2}$; we can find $R$ in $O(1)$ and build our answer as -\n$\\newline$\n\nWe are able to compute $R'$ directly from $L'$, unlike other methods such as RMQ or Binary Lifting, where we build our answer from already calculated $L$ and $R$ on independent smaller ranges to later combine them to compute the answer for the bigger range.\nTime Complexity: Finding $R = f(L)$ is $O(1)$, so total time complexity is $O(log(n))$. \nImplementation\nThe below function only works if $n$ is even. One simple way to handle the odd case is to break the expression as $a^n = a \\cdot a^{n-1}$. We can get the answer for $a^{n-1}$ because it's even ans whether $n$ is even or odd, in $\\leq 2$ steps $n$ definitely gets halved which ensures that the time complexity remains $O(log(n))$.\n\nExample 2: Summation of GP Series\nConsidering a standard GP series, we find its summation as\n$\\newline$\n$$ans = 1 + r + r^{2} \\dots r^{n-1} = \\frac{r^{n}-1}{r-1}$$\nIf we have to find the summation under arbitrary MOD then it's not necessary that $(r-1)^{-1}$ exists, and so we alternatively express our sum as\n\nwhich gives $R = f(L) = r^{\\frac{n}{2}} \\cdot L$.\nTo handle the case for odd $n$ during implementation, we can break series as\n$\\newline$\n$ans = 1 + a \\cdot \\underbrace{(1 + a + a^2 + \\dots + a^{n-2})}_\\text{say sum is S}$\nWe can find $S$ as $(n - 1)$ is even, and final answer will be $= 1 + a \\cdot S$.\nTime Complexity: Computing $R = f(L)$ is $O(log(n))$, so our total time complexity becomes $O(log(n)^{2})$. But we can calculate powers of $r$ along with our series, so we restrict the final time complexity to $O(log(n))$.\nImplementation\nNaive Approach ($O(log(n)^{2})$)\n\nNow, applying our optimization, we compute { $ { r^n ,1 + r \\dots + r^{n-1} } $ } together for a final time complexity of $O(logn)$\n\nWe can use a similar idea for calculating GP series of matrices $= I + A + A^2  + \\dots + A^{n-1}$. Just like integers under modulo, we can't always guarantee $(A-I)^{-1}$ exists.\nContest Example: In AtCoder ABC 293 Task E the task is to just compute the sum of a GP series.\nExample 3: Summation of AP-GP series\nWe start by considering the simple series $\\displaystyle  r + 2 \\cdot r^2 + 3 \\cdot r^3 \\dots + (n-1)\\cdot r^{n-1} = \\sum\\limits_{i=0}^{n-1} i\\cdot r^i$. For this we express the summation as below\n\n\nNow we solve for $R = f(L)$.\nSolution for R as a function of L\n$$R = (\\frac{n}{2} + 0) \\cdot r^{\\frac{n}{2}} + (\\frac{n}{2} + 1) \\cdot r^{\\frac{n}{2}+1} + \\dots + (\\frac{n}{2} + i) \\cdot r^{\\frac{n}{2}+i} + \\dots + (\\frac{n}{2} + \\frac{n}{2}-1) \\cdot r^{\\frac{n}{2} + \\frac{n}{2}-1}$$\n\n$$\\implies R = r^{\\frac{n}{2}} \\cdot \\left( \\frac{n}{2} \\cdot \\underbrace{\\left( 1 + r^{1} + \\dots + r^{i} + \\dots + r^{\\frac{n}{2}-1} \\right)}_{\\text{GP series}} + L \\right)$$\nWe shall call this GP series as $L_{0}$, whose sum we can already calculate efficiently. Hence,\n$$R = r^{\\frac{n}{2}} \\cdot \\left( \\frac{n}{2} \\cdot L_{0} + L \\right)$$\n$$\\implies R  = f(L_{0},L) = r^{\\frac{n}{2}} \\cdot \\left( \\frac{n}{2} \\cdot L_{0} + L \\right)$$\nTo handle the odd case during implementation, we express summation as:\n$\\newline$\n$$sum = r + 2\\cdot r^2 + \\dots + (n-1) \\cdot r^{n-1}$$\n$$= \\left(r + r^2 + \\dots + r^i + \\dots + r^{n-1} \\right) + \\left( r^2 + 2\\cdot r^3 + \\dots + (i-1)\\cdot r^{i-1} + \\dots + (n-2)\\cdot r^{n-1} \\right)$$\n\nWe can get $X$ and $Y$ because they are of even length, and our final answer will be $= r \\cdot X + r \\cdot Y$ .\nTime Complexity: To get $R$ we need to solve $L_{0}$ which takes $O(log(n))$ so total will be $O(log(n)^2)$, but we can calculate powers of $r$, $L_{0}$ and $L$ together which makes total time $O(log(n))$.\nImplementation\n\n\n\nAtCoder ABC 129 task F is a good practice example for the ideas in the blog.\nGeneralising the above series summations\nNow, let us consider $\\displaystyle S(n,m) = ‎‎\\sum\\limits_{i=0}^{n-1} i^m \\cdot r^i$. Then we would have GP $= S(n,0)$ and AP-GP $= S(n,1)$. Hence,\n$\\newline$\n\nHere $L_{m,\\frac{n}{2}} = S(\\frac{n}{2},m)$. Then, $S(n,m) = L_{m,\\frac{n}{2}} + R_{m,\\frac{n}{2}}$, We need to compute $R_{m,\\frac{n}{2}}$.\n$\\newline$\n$$\\displaystyle R_{m,\\frac{n}{2}} = r^{\\frac{n}{2}} \\cdot \\left( (\\frac{n}{2})^m + (\\frac{n}{2}+1)^m \\cdot r + \\dots + (\\frac{n}{2} + i)^m \\cdot r^i + \\dots (\\frac{n}{2} + \\frac{n}{2} - 1)^m \\cdot r^{\\frac{n}{2}-1} \\right)$$\n$$\\displaystyle R_{m,\\frac{n}{2}} = r^{\\frac{n}{2}} \\cdot \\left( \\sum\\limits_{i=0}^{\\frac{n}{2}-1} \\left( \\sum\\limits_{j=0}^{m} \\binom{m}{j} \\left(\\frac{n}{2}\\right)^{m-j} \\cdot i^j \\right) \\cdot r^i  \\right) $$\nNow, swapping the summations -\n$$\\displaystyle R_{m,\\frac{n}{2}} = r^{\\frac{n}{2}} \\cdot \\left( \\sum\\limits_{j=0}^{m} \\binom{m}{j} \\left( \\frac{n}{2}\\right) ^{m-j} \\underbrace{\\left( \\sum\\limits_{i=0}^{\\frac{n}{2}-1} i^j \\cdot r^i \\right)}_\\text{L(j,n/2)}   \\right) $$\nFinally,\n$$\\displaystyle R_{m,\\frac{n}{2}} = r^{\\frac{n}{2}} \\cdot \\left( \\sum\\limits_{j=0}^{m} \\binom{m}{j} \\left( \\frac{n}{2}\\right) ^{m-j} \\cdot L_{j,\\frac{n}{2}}   \\right) = r^{\\frac{n}{2}} \\cdot \\left( \\sum\\limits_{j=0}^{m} \\binom{m}{j} \\left( \\frac{n}{2}\\right) ^{m-j} \\cdot S_{\\frac{n}{2},j}   \\right) $$\nAs $j \\leq m$ if we calculate everything together, just like above and hence know the value of every $L_{j,\\frac{n}{2}}$ without any extra time. We can validate our results for the above illustrated examples of AP and AP-GP series.\nValidating our results against our previous examples\nCase 1: for $m=0$ , which is simple GP series\n$R_{0,\\frac{n}{2}} = r^{\\frac{n}{2}} \\cdot \\left( \\sum\\limits_{j=0}^{0} \\binom{0}{j} \\left( \\frac{n}{2}\\right) ^{0-j} \\cdot L_{j,\\frac{n}{2}}   \\right) = r^{\\frac{n}{2}} \\cdot L_{0,\\frac{n}{2}}$\nCase 2: for $m=1$ , which is AP-GP series\n$R_{1,\\frac{n}{2}} = r^{\\frac{n}{2}} \\cdot \\left( \\sum\\limits_{j=0}^{1} \\binom{1}{j} \\left( \\frac{n}{2}\\right) ^{1-j} \\cdot L_{j,\\frac{n}{2}}   \\right) = r^{\\frac{n}{2}} \\cdot \\left(  \\left( \\frac{n}{2}\\right) ^{1} \\cdot L_{0,\\frac{n}{2}} +  L_{1,\\frac{n}{2}} \\right)$\nWe can now evaluate our original summation as $\\displaystyle S_{n,m} = S_{\\frac{n}{2},m} + r^{\\frac{n}{2}} \\cdot \\left( \\sum\\limits_{j=0}^{m} \\binom{m}{j} \\left( \\frac{n}{2}\\right) ^{m-j} \\cdot S_{\\frac{n}{2},j}   \\right)$.\nHandling Odd Case\nWe have $\\displaystyle S_{n,m} = \\sum\\limits_{i=0}^{n-1} i^m \\cdot r^i = r \\cdot \\left( \\sum\\limits_{i=1}^{n-2} (i+1)^m \\cdot r^i \\right)$. However we can only write this if $m&gt;0$ but for $m=0$ first term will not be $0$ but instead be $\\displaystyle \\lim_{x \\to 0} x^x = 1$. So for $m=0$ we will add $1$ instead of $0$, keeping the remainder of the expression same. Thus\n$$\\displaystyle S_{n,m} = r \\cdot \\left( \\sum\\limits_{i=0}^{n-2} \\sum\\limits_{j=0}^{m} \\binom{m}{j} i^j \\cdot r^i \\right)$$\nAnd swapping summations\n\nfor $m$ &gt; $0$.\nHence, we have the final result as:\n$$\n\\displaystyle\n\\begin{equation}\nS_{n,m}=\n\\begin{cases}\n1 + r \\cdot S_{n-1,0}  &amp; \\text{if } m=0\\\nr \\cdot \\left(\\displaystyle \\sum\\limits_{j=0}^{m} \\binom{m}{j} S_{n-1,j} \\right) &amp; \\text{if } m &gt; 0\n\\end{cases}\n\\end{equation}\n$$\nWe can also construct a clean visualization of the even and odd cases using matrix multiplication instead of summation. These are illustrated as below.\nOdd Case\nDimensions are: $(m+1,1) = (m+1,m+2) \\cdot (m+2,1)$.\n\nWe will return the array $(S_{n,0},S_{n,1}, \\dots , S_{n,m}, r^n)$.\nEven Case\nDimension are: $(m+1,1) = (m+1,m+1) \\cdot (m+1,1)$.\n\nWe will return the array $(L_{0, n/2} + R_{0, n/2},L_{1, n/2} + R_{1, n/2}, \\dots , L_{m, n/2} + R_{m, n/2}, r^n)$.\nIn the above cases, whenever we are computing values of $R_{j, n / 2} \\hspace{0.25cm} \\text{for} \\hspace{0.25cm} j \\in [0, m]$, they still indeed maintain our original form of $R = f(L)$ as we can express them as\n$$\\vec{R_{\\frac{n}{2}}} = f(\\vec{L})= r^{\\frac{n}{2}} \\left( M(n,m) \\cdot \\vec{L_{\\frac{n}{2}}} \\right) $$\nTime Complexity:  To find $R_{j,\\frac{n}{2}}$ takes summation of $m$ terms and we do that for every $j \\leq m$ which will take $O(m^2)$. So, total complexity is $O(m^2 \\cdot log(n)).$\nImplementation\n\n\nPrecalculation of $nCr$ takes $O(m^2)$.\n\n\nDuring our computations, whenever we have even $n$ we need to compute $(\\frac{n}{2})^j$ for each $j \\leq m$, which takes $O(m \\cdot log(n))$.\n\n\nTotal complexity $O(m^2 + m \\cdot log(n) + m^2 \\cdot log(n))$ asymptotically remains same $O(m^2 \\cdot log(n))$ .\n\n","id":"https://srayan.in/posts/series-summation-with-binary-exponentiation/","title":"Calculating Series Sums with Binary Exponentiation"}},"docInfo":{"https://srayan.in/":{"body":76,"title":1},"https://srayan.in/posts/":{"body":0,"title":1},"https://srayan.in/posts/series-summation-with-binary-exponentiation/":{"body":976,"title":5}},"length":3},"lang":"English"}
